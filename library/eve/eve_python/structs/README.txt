Run PythonCTypeGenerator.py to generate CType structs from EveCStructs/include/ and EveSDK/include directories.

The Visual Studio solution generated by CMake will run this command automatically during the install step.
We allow these files to be committed to Git to make life easier for python devs, it is preferrable you do not
modify these files manually, since they will just get overridden by the next time someone changes the C includes
and runs the install step again.
